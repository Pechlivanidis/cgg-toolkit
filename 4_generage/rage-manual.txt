Introduction
------------
GeneRAGE is an algorithm for clustering protein sequences into families
based on similarity information obtained from BLAST or other such sequence
similarity search algorithms. GeneRAGE uses a novel method for removal
of false-positive and false-negative BLAST similarity assignments by
calling a fast Smith-Waterman routine (PRSS3), which also allows detection
and resolution of multi-domain proteins. This detection and correction step
allows rapid accurate clustering of protein sequences into families.

Licensing
---------

GeneRAGE is free for academic and non-profit use. Source code is not available
but binaries from most platforms are easily available. Please read the license.txt
file for information about the academic license. For commercial and profit-making
use of geneRAGE, you must obtain a commercial license. 

Contact rage@ebi.ac.uk for commercial license information.







**** IMPORTANT ****

Please make sure you have PRSS3 installed before you run geneRAGE.
PRSS3 is part of Bill Pearson's FASTA (3.3) package which can be obtained at:

ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/software/unix/fasta/fasta33t07b.shar.Z

When you have installed the prss33 binary, then set the environment
variable PRSSDIR to the directory containing the binary.

Example you have installed prss33 at /usr/local/seqanal/bin/prss33
type 'setenv PRSSDIR /usr/local/seqanal/bin/'

Without setting PRSSDIR, GeneRAGE will search for the prss33 binary
in the default path.



GeneRAGE Input Format
---------------------

GeneRAGE requires two files as input for a clustering run.

1) A FASTA formatted sequence file containing all sequences to be clustered

2) A Parsed similarity file containing pairwise similarities between all proteins
in the FASTA sequence file (Generally produced from a BLAST results file).

Example Parsed File:

ACT2_ARATH      ACTB_XENBO      
ACT2_ARATH      ACTB_CRIGR      
ACT2_ARATH      ACTB_SALSA      
ACT2_ARATH      ACT2_HALRO      
ACT2_ARATH      ACTD_STRPU      
ACT2_ARATH      ACTT_FUGRU     

A Perl script 'parse' is provided to make a parsed similarity file from an NCBI
BLASTp 2.0 results file.

eg. perl parse results.out > results.parsed

Output Format
-------------

GeneRAGE produces two output files

1) clusters.out

A File containing all proteins and which cluster they belong to. This file generally
needs to be sorted with 'sort -n clusters.out' to sort by cluster number. Clusters
are all numeric and start at cluster 1. Multi-Domain information is also contained in
this file.

Example clusters.out file:

Cluster #	Protein
---------	-------
1               USO1_YEAST Multi-Domain Family
1               UTRO_HUMAN Domain 1
1               VINC_CAEEL
1               VINC_CHICK
1               VINC_HUMAN Domain 1
1               VINC_MOUSE Domain 1
1               YB3D_SCHPO Domain 1
1               YGW6_YEAST Domain 1
2               ACT1_ARATH 
2               ACT1_ARTSX 
2               ACT1_BOMMO 
2               ACT1_DAUCA 
2               ACT1_DICDI 
2               ACT1_DROME 
2               ACT1_FUGRU 

** Important **
Given the way in which the multi-domain detection step is implemented, it is possible
for any given protein to be in multiple clusters if it contains multiple-domains.

2) paralogues.out

A file showing all remaining similarities for any given protein, after both passes
of the algorithm

Example paralogues.out file:

Protein			Colon Separated List of its remaining homologues
-------			------------------------------------------------
AGI6_TRYBB
AKA5_BOVIN              AKA5_HUMAN
AKA5_HUMAN              AKA5_BOVIN
AKAC_HUMAN
AKR_ARATH               ANK1_HUMAN:ANK1_MOUSE:ANK2_HUMAN:Q61307:Q63618:Q9QY27:Q9Z2B4
AL11_SCHPO              41_HUMAN:41_MOUSE:41_XENLA:AAC1_HUMAN:AAC2_HUMAN:AAC3_HUMAN






Running GeneRAGE
----------------

Assuming prss33 is installed from the FASTA package and the PRSSDIR environment
variable is set, then geneRAGE can be run as follows:

'generage sequences.fasta sequences.parsed'

Output files will be created in the directory from which the program was called.


GeneRAGE Command Line Options
-----------------------------

-help			Show some helpful information on commandline options
-verbose		Run GeneRAGE in verbose mode (Useful to see whats going on)
-nosym			Turn off the symmetrification step (Not Recommended)
-nomd			Turn off the multi-domain detection step (Not Recommended)
-exhaustive		Turn off all optimizations (Slower but more accurate)
-z1			Smith-Waterman Z-Score Threshold for symmetrification (Default=10)
-z2			Smith-Waterman Z-Score Threshold for multi-domain detection (Default=2)

For large runs (> 1000 proteins) it is recommended to run rage with the verbose mode,
sending output into a log file which can be monitored during the run.
